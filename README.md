## Abstract

"Online" data assimilation (DA) is used to generate a new seasonal-resolution reanalysis dataset over the last millennium by combining forecasts from an ocean--atmosphere--sea-ice coupled linear inverse model with climate proxy records. Instrumental verification reveals that this reconstruction achieves the highest correlation skill, while using fewer proxies, in surface temperature reconstructions compared to other paleo-DA products, particularly during boreal winter when proxy data are scarce. Reconstructed ocean and sea-ice variables also have high correlation with instrumental and satellite datasets. Verification against independent proxy records shows that reconstruction skill is robust throughout the last millennium. Analysis of the results reveals that the method effectively captures the seasonal evolution and amplitude of El Niño events. Reconstructed seasonal temperature variations are consistent with trends in orbital forcing over the last millennium.

## Significance Statement 

This paper introduces the first seasonal-resolution reanalysis of the last millennium, based on an "online" data assimilation method using a linear inverse model to assimilate paleoclimate proxies. We find good agreement when verifying the reconstruction against modern instrumental reanalyses and out-of-sample proxies. Results show that seasonal temperature trends are similar to predictions from orbital-insolation trends, and seasonal variability of modern El Niño events is similar to instrumental reanalyses.
